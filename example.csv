I discussed this issue Friday with Paul, however, since it is an issue I am 
not entirely knowledgeable about, I think Paul should run this by you...

Tana,

As a follow up to Friday's discoveries, on the commodities side, it appears 
as though the agencies which regulate the commodity exchanges drive the rules 
regarding safeguarding of client accounts.  Other than 1) the US exchanges 
(which are all governed by the CFTC), and  2) the OMLX, and the IPE (which we 
have already addressed),  what are the other exchanges whose contracts we 
trade?  

Thanks

May 31, 2001

TO:
All NYMEX Division Members and Member Firms

FROM:
Neal L. Wolkoff, Executive Vice President

RE:
Reminder on Use of Money Market Funds as Original Margin Deposits on the NYMEX Division

DATE:
May 31, 2001
===========================================================
This Notice is a reminder regarding certain rule changes and related policy guidelines that will go into effect on June 1, 2001 for the NYMEX Division.  The rule changes going into effect on June 1, 2001 on the NYMEX Division allow shares of certain money market mutual funds to be acceptable for purposes of original margin deposits.

Corresponding rule changes for the COMEX Division  have also been approved by the NYMEX Board of Directors and filed with the CFTC; the changes for the COMEX Division will be implemented at a later date.

	Rule Amendments
The amendments generally require that in order to be used for such purpose, a money market fund must be approved by the NYMEX Board and also must comply with CFTC Regulation ? 1.25.  For purposes of original margin, the Exchange's Clearing House will value such money market fund shares at 95% of their market value.  In addition, a Clearing Member's participation in any approved fund or any group of approved funds offered by the same issuer shall be limited to the greater of $250,000 or 25% of the Clearing Member's total original margin obligations. Finally, no more than 25% of the total assets of an approved money market mutual fund may be used to meet original margin obligations at the Exchange.

Exchange Policy on Money Market Funds
The NYMEX Board of Directors also recently adopted three additional guidelines that will be applicable to such funds. First, until further notice from the Exchange, the Board has determined to limit the number of money market funds available for this purpose to ten. Second, the Board will require that henceforth each fund applying for such status must have a minimum value of $5 billion.  Finally, each fund further must provide for same day payment if notification is made by 3:00 p.m. on that day.

If you have any questions concerning this change, please contact Bernard Purta, Senior Vice President, Regulatory Affairs and Operations, at (212) 299- 2380; Arthur McCoy, Vice President, Financial Surveillance Section, NYMEX Compliance Department, at (212) 299-2928; or Joseph Sanguedolce, Director, Financial Surveillance Section, NYMEX Compliance Department, at (212) 299-2855.

AMENDMENTS TO NYMEX RULE 9.05 (""MARGINS"")

(Asterisks indicate additions; brackets indicate deletions.)

Rule 9.05. MARGINS

*	*	*	*
(E) Clearing Members may meet original margin calls by depositing:



*(4) Shares in a money market mutual fund that complies with CFTC Regulation ?1.25 and that has been approved by the Board, subject to the following conditions:

(i)	for purposes of original margin, such shares will be valued at 95% of market value;
(ii)	a Clearing Member's participation in any approved fund or any group of approved funds offered by the same issuer shall be limited to the greater of $250,000 or 25% of the Clearing Member's total original margin obligations;
(iii)	no more than 25% of the total assets of an approved money market mutual fund may be used to meet original margin obligations at the Exchange.*

[Shares of Brown Brothers Harriman & Co. Common Settlement Fund, valued at 95% of market value.]

Hi, Julie.  I really appreciate you getting this information for me.  The 
company/cost centers that I need the information for are as follows:

0413/105633
0012/105982

The reason we need this information is because there are some people who are 
Houston Pipe Line employees, and we want to ensure that they have or do not 
have the applications they are required or not required to have.  Tom Martin 
is over the Texas Desk, and he is the person who would like this 
information.  

Thanks again!

                    Your Date of Migration is: May 23rd

  YOU WILL BE UNABLE TO SEND E-MAIL unless you take the following action:


Please go through your Notes email and clean out as many old/un-needed
email items as possible BEFORE your date of migration.? After you are
migrated to Outlook you will only be allocated 100MB of total Mailbox
space.?? If more than this amount of data is migrated to Outlook YOU WILL
NOT BE ABLE TO SEND E-MAIL until it is below the 100MB limit.? Cleaning up
your Notes email now will prevent this from happening to YOU.

Enron's messaging platform is migrating from Lotus Notes to Microsoft
Outlook 2000 worldwide.  You will be accessing Outlook for all of your
email functions.

WHY IS ENRON MIGRATING TO OUTLOOK 2000?

Many factors contributed to the decision to migrate from Lotus Notes to
Microsoft Exchange/Outlook.  The most prominent factors were:

?    Significant advantages to moving to a product that is more integrated
with current Enron apps (Windows 2000, Office and Internet Explorer)
?    More efficient Shared PC and Roaming User features
?    Improved support and integration for Palm/CE devices
?    Instant Messaging capabilities

WHAT IS BEING MIGRATED TO OUTLOOK 2000?

?    Email Messages.  From the date of your scheduled migration, the last
(30) thirty days of your Email will be converted for use in Outlook.
?    All your folders in Notes you use to store email messages in.
?    To Do Items
?    Journal Items
?    Calendar Entries dating from (1) one year in the past to (10) ten
years in the future will be converted.
?    Address Books, but NOT your Distribution Lists that you created.  You
will need to re-create these in Outlook.

Regarding everything we talked today in all research meeting I was wondering how all these things are going to affect my situation. As we talked couple months ago I was trying to get ready to be employed full time in the new year. So in this case what do you recommend me to do? Shall we stick to what we talked before or shall we wait and see what time is going to bring? It'd be really nice if you could give some kind of direction.

As you know we are trying to eliminate all the plugs on the Gas Benchmark.  
Therefore we would like to begin pulling your positions from the GRMS 
system.  I have attached a file that shows the position that I got when I 
queried GRMS for the June 14 position.  I have also included the detail and a 
copy of what you reported.  

As you will see these positions are significantly different.  Please look at 
the detail and let me know if you see the reason for the descrepancy (ie 
books that we have omitted).  Let me know if you need more information.

The only modifications to ECFC's online GTC's are as follows:

Contract Formation In order to maintain consistency with the other product 
lines online GTCs, we've modified this section to reflect the same 
introduction as reflected in ELFI, EGLI, ERAC and EPC.

Damages and Limitation We've added a 2 line bilateral provision regarding 
payment.

Financial Information We've added the two paragraphs re credit provisions as 
reflected in the confirmations.

Compliance with U.S. Laws We've added the buyer/seller trade sanctions as 
reflected in the confirmations.

Law and Jurisdiction We replaced this section in its entirety with the new 
policy in effect as of June 1998.

Appendix II We've added the Marine Provisions Addendum.

Appendix III We've added the Transportation Addendum.

Very shortly after we spoke, I was informed that we had lost the Enron
HomePC Program. This is a great emotional blow to us and I am beyond
disappointed.

We understood that given our recent  strong performance against Dell, they
would do anything to embarrass us in our own backyard.  We have very strong
insight into their intent and knew they would  use this aggressively in
their PR campaigns.

However, clearly it was our job to win the business on the merits of the
individual program and to compete hard for it. We believed that we had a
creative offer on the table that would create great value for your
employees. Obviously, we did not perform to your expectations.

Following is the summary of our activities together which was created before
we heard the news.

I pride myself in developing strong executive relationships with our
customers, and I would welcome the opportunity for us to put our heads
together in order to look for ways we can move the relationships between our
two companies to a higher level.

I also think we should discuss the PR positioning. As a member of our Board,
and as a leader in the Houston community this will be news and I am hopeful
we can find a creative way to balance it.

Again, I accept it was ours to win in the marketplace but regret it had to
come to this. I look forward to your call.

From our Enron team:



* EBS Product and Service Supply Agreement

Compaq will continue to honor the Product and Service Supply Agreement
executed on January 18 between EBS and Compaq, whereby Compaq agreed to
purchase broadband services from EBS (on a take or pay basis) in proportion
to EBS' purchase of NT servers and attached storage.  It is also important
to note that we have been actively partnering with EBS on non-contractual
areas, such as our ongoing technical joint development and marketing efforts
around the Windows Streaming Media product.  I understand that our teams
have been working very closely together -- and with Microsoft -- to resolve
technical issues with Windows Streaming Media and thereby speed EBS' market
deployment.

The major issue is that Enron does not support traffic to many of our
concentration point so we need to be creative.

Bottom line, we are down to solvable problems with solution activities
underway.

* Windows 2000


During the last week of May Compaq responded to a request from Enron to
support Windows 2000 deployments, and placed people on site with no defined
contract or process due to Enron's requirements.  At this writing, no
contract has been signed, and the current contract iteration is at number
fourteen.  Apparently the delivery scope has changed several times and there
have been a few mistrals. Compaq is continuing to provide resources despite
the fact that no contract is in place and will work with Enron to ensure a
successful completion of the project.

* Power Management

Jesse Greene, our CFO, will act as the contact point for Enron for power
management services. The issue is we have existing contracts at favorable
rates but we will break the log jam.

* HomePC Program

For several months, Compaq and Enron have been working the solution to bring
technology and Internet access into the homes of every Enron employee.
There have been many creative discussions around hardware and financing to
allow Enron to fully subsidize the package provided.  Compaq, Enron and
Compaq Financial Services had gotten to a point where the $35 per month cap
was going to require the specifications of the hardware to be reduced.  In
recognition of the value of our partnership and our mutual desire for this
program to be the premier program in the industry, we have increased the
specifications of the hardware while taking significant pricing actions and
financing rate reductions.  These actions will actually allow Enron to
support better than expected hardware with the extended warranty for $34.28
per month.   This will truly be an industry-leading program when launched
later this fall.",Enron Emails

I have not heard anything from Mr  Lay'soffice yet as a response to the email I sent last week. I am very sorry we have come to this but I have already contacted law firms in Braziland Houstonto evaluate my options for enforcing my contractual rights. I understand Enron is in a difficult situation but the payments were due and the invoice was sent long before Enron got into the present problems. This course of action is not what I want,especially given the fact that there is a serious risk this may become public in Brazil, causing additional unnecessary problems to Enron.
 
Once the lawyers come up with a recommended course of action, and out of respect for Enron and Mr Lay, I will place an additional call informing you and Mr Lay's office of the actions that will be taken. This should take place this week.
 
Please let me know immediately if you hear anything regarding the authorization of the payment. Also please acknowledge receipt of this email.

Subject: Re: Document Retention  

Well, I'm not sure how responsive Dot's response was to your initial 
communication, but I agree that there is a 10 year retention policy on 
contracts and agreements and their backup.  This to me would only apply to 
all of the gas purchase contracts we pulled from storage, most of which are 
probably close to the end of the 10 years.  Litigation workpapers, which to 
me would include all of the pleadings, correspondence, discovery, exhibits, 
depositions, etc., have a six year retention.  The other documents we pulled 
from storage but didn't produce, such as Mike McGowan's and Mary Kay's old 
files on take-or-pay issues, FERC orders, etc., would have different 
retention policies depending upon their content.

2 questions :

- I assume if we produced an old 3-year plan, even though it should have been 
destroyed long ago, it would now fall under the 6 year litigation workpaper 
retention policy? 

-Do you think documents from the first trial have to ""start over"" and be kept 
for another 6 years?",Enron Emails

40,"Dear Don,  The Washington bureau will have a full plate when we return from Thanksgiving break.  Congress returns with many lawmakers urging action on energy legislation before the end of the year.  Washington Bureau Chief Peter Cook says there's a long list of legislation ahead of energy in the Democrat-controlled Senate, but Republicans are threatening to force a vote through a filibuster.  In turn, Democrats are saying they'll filibuster any energy bill containing a provision to open Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to drilling.  The legislation battle continues next week.   Peter also says the Washington bureau will continue to follow the FERC's major decisions regarding how it assesses market power.  The Commission announced a major change this week that will impact many of the large and small utilities across the country.   Also next week, we'll see what Energy Daily Publisher Llewellyn King has to say about Pat Wood's performance as Chairman of the FERC.  And rumors are flying about DOE Secretary Spencer Abraham - on Monday, King talks about the whispers he's hearing in Washington.   ENL's Gale Smith will have a report from the Houston bureau next week on a Louisiana company that uses rice hulls to create power.  Agrilectric Incorporated consumes some of this power, but most of the electricity is sold to an area utility company.  We'll have details next week.   Also, Houston Correspondent Kim Benestante will bring us coverage from the Alaska Resources Conference taking place next Thursday and Friday.  We'll also bring you details on the final report regarding the chosen route of the Arctic natural gas pipeline.  The report is due to Alaska's Governor on November 30.   We'll hear from Center for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Technologies Executive Director John White next week.  ENL's Kym McNicholas will speak with White about his organization's opposition to the state's long-term power contracts.  Catch White from the West Coast bureau next week.   Closing Prices for Nov. 21, 2001:   Crude: $18.96       Unleaded: $0.5273   Heating Oil: $0.5342   Natural Gas: $2.813    Keep in mind things are subject to change at a moment's notice. Occasionally guests have to cancel or change time slots.  We'll continue to do our best to keep you updated on future interviews and events. Have a great Thanksgiving break!  We'll see you on Monday.   Be sure to watch our newscasts every business day - 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. ET, at the top of each hour.

Jim and Rob:

I thought you might be interested in seeing a translation of an article that 
came out in Gazeta Mercantil (the ""WSJ"" of Brazil) the day we signed the 
interruptible gas transportation contract with TBG.  This is the deal we 
discussed in which we got comfortable with in-country arbitration in Brazil 
based on the relatively small size of the deal, its consistency with our 
practice in similar trading transactions in other parts of the world, and its 
importance to the commercial team in being able to implement our gas trading 
strategy in the region.  As you can see below, despite the deal's small size, 
Enron's success in forcing open the market for interruptible gas 
transportation in Brazil made a big impression.  The commercial team tells me 
they now have their sights set on opening the firm service market.  We'll be 
hoping for similar success there.

Regards,
 John

ENRON BREAKS STATE GAS MONOPOLY
By Nicola Pamplona

The state monopoly on transportation of natural gas ended today with the 
execution of the first Fuel Transportation Agreement by a private entity in 
Brazil. Enersil, a subsidiary of the North American company Enron, will carry 
1 million cubic meters of gas per day through the Brasil-Bolivia Pipeline 
(Gasbol), operated by TBG, a company which has Petrobr?s as a majority 
shareholder. Negotiations with respect to the use of the pipeline have lasted 
for almost a year, punctuated by divergences on price and technical aspects 
of the services.

 The National Oil and Gas Agency (ANP) celebrates the execution of the 
agreement with a ceremony to take place today at the agency,s headquarters in 
Rio de Janeiro.  The agreement not only represents the opening of the market 
for transportation of natural gas, but also the end of the first arbitration 
proceeding submitted to the agency.  According to the involved parties, the 
proceeding was very complicated due to the non-existence of previous 
standards and to the fact that such market is only in its incipient stage. So 
much so that, after the ANP,s decision, it took over a month for the contract 
to be ready for execution. 

 &ANP has guaranteed competitiveness to the market and also acquired 
experience for future arbitration proceedings8 says Enron Vice-President to 
regulatory affairs, Mr. Robert Gross.  According to him, the proceeding lead 
to the definition of a model contract which may be used for future interested 
parties in transporting gas through Gasbol.  The main inclusion was the 
distance factor to the tariff calculation, an issue that has never made part 
of TBG,s plans under the argument that it would prevent the return of the US$ 
2 billions invested in the pipeline. 

&On top of that, there have been a number of general terms and conditions to 
the services which have been made more clear to the market"", highlights 
Gross. Enron, however, has not succeed with respect to pricing the 
transportation tariff in the agreement which has been fixed to US$ 1,15 per 
million of BTUs (British thermal units).  At the end of last year, when the 
negotiations started, the company was asking for a tariff with a 25% discount 
rate, as it referred to an interruptible service, i.e, services that use 
capacity already paid but not taken by third parties.

Such services can be interrupted by the carrier, namely TBG, in the event the 
company that has contracted the capacity in first place decides to increase 
the volume  to be transported.  ""It is a lower quality service, which is why 
we requested a lower price"", explains the officer.  ANP, however, has 
understood that  since the volume transported through Gasbol is still very 
far from full capacity, the transport would not in fact be interrupted, 
incorporating thus the features of non-interruptible service.  ""We 
understand, however that, as the market develops, the tariff for the 
interruptible services will tend to fall"", he states.",Enron Emails

              COMMISSION MOVES TO BRING RELIEF TO CALIFORNIA 
                            ELECTRICITY MARKETS

          In response to emergency conditions that exist in the
     California electricity markets, which have faced supply shortages
     and snowballing prices, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission
     today approved a price cap change requested by the California
     Independent System Operator (ISO).   The Commission also took
     steps to permit qualifying facilities (QFs) to operate at full
     capacity.

          The ISO's purchase price cap of $250/Mwh will be lifted. 
     Bids above that amount will be allowed but will not set the
     clearing price paid to all sellers, as does the current purchase
     price cap.  This should attract more bids and alleviate chronic
     supply shortages.  
          
          Those bidding above $250 will be required to report their
     bids to the Commission on a weekly basis and provide certain cost
     information.  

          The non-profit ISO and PX began operations in California in
     1998.  The PX is the scheduling coordinator for the IOUs as well
     as other market participants.   The ISO operates and controls
     most of the transmission system in California.

          In addition to the $250 purchase price cap, the Commission
     also authorized the ISO to penalize participating generators that
     refuse to operate in response to an ISO request in an emergency.  
     They will be charged an amount equal to twice the highest price
     the ISO paid for energy for each hour in which the participating
     generator failed to respond.   

          The ISO's costs of obtaining energy through bids above the
     purchase price cap or through out-of-market dispatches will be
     assigned to scheduling coordinators who depend too much on spot
     markets.

          The Commission's second order enables QF entities to
     generate at full capacity which in the past could have caused
     them to lose QF status.  QF generators are small power producers
     that use alternative fuels, such as solar or biomass, and
     cogenerators that produce both electricity and steam for
     commercial use.   

          The order on QF entities was in response to a request from a
     California QF.

          The orders are effective immediately.

78,"As we return to our regular business activities following last week's tragic events, we wanted to disseminate as widely as possible the following information on security and travel.  Updates will be posted as necessary under ""bulletins"" on the Corporate Security website located at www.home.enron.com.

We do not believe that any terrorist groups will target Enron's employees or facilities.  As a precautionary measure, however, we have increased security in and around our facilities.  We urge all employees to maintain a heightened sense of awareness and to immediately report any suspicious activity to Enron Corporate Security in Houston at (713) 345-2804. 

All non-essential business travel should be postponed until further notice.   Airline schedules and flights will be disrupted for some time - and bomb hoaxes, false alarms, and increased security measures will result in additional delays and disruptions.  In addition, all carriers, particularly U.S. carriers and those of U.S. allies such as Israel and NATO member countries, may be at risk for copycat hijackings.

	We realize that, as Enron conducts its business, some air travel is unavoidable.   Enron employees who wish to discuss their travel options should contact Corporate Security at (713) 345-2804 or via email at CorporateSecurity@enron.com.   

	U.S. military action in retaliation for the terrorist attacks may result in violent Islamic extremist reactions in a number of countries, particularly in Afghanistan, Yemen, and Pakistan, as well as in Egypt, Iran, Iraq, Israel, Gaza/West Bank, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Libya, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Syria and Tajikistan.  Reactions could take the form of acts by individuals or organized groups against U.S. government or commercial facilities.  All travel to or through these countries should be canceled.

Most of the U.S.' busiest airports have implemented the FAA's stepped-up security measures and are open and operating, with the exception of Washington Reagan National Airport.  If you are traveling by air, allow plenty of time to check in under these new security procedures.  Contact your carrier directly to find out about flight schedules and specific boarding requirements.  You can find more information on the new security standards as well as a list of airports that have certified they can meet the new security standards on the FAA's website at http://www.faa.gov.",Enron Emails

not be transmitted until there is a fed ref number tomorrow.  The opinion 
letter will be faxed as soon as the GC is available, or Kent can sign for Dan

The LOC is in the works, and GE understands that 10% will be retained in

There will be three original opinions.  There is one original guaranty, and 
I'm not certain of GE's willingness to give more than that.  Obviously, there

Subject: Request to intervene and reply to Indicated Shipper and Dynegy's  
Request for Rehearing, Texas Eastern Transmission Corp., Docket No. CP95- 
218-003




MEMORANDUM

TO:???? ??????? Regulatory Policy Commission 
FROM:?? Joan Dreskin 
DATE:?? ??????? January 31, 2001 
RE:???? ??????? Request to intervene and reply to Indicated Shipper and 
Dynegy's Request for Rehearing, Texas Eastern Transmission Corp., Docket No. 
CP95-218-003.

??????? On January 16, Indicated Shippers and Dynegy took rehearing of the 
Texas Eastern order that held that pipelines do not need preapproval from 
FERC to acquire capacity on other pipelines.? Indicated Shippers and Dynegy 
took rehearing on the following grounds: (1) The Commission order is 
procedurally defective in that it repeals a Commission regulation, 18 CFR o 
284.242, without following a notice and comment rulemaking procedures; (2) 
The old Texas Eastern policy has been effective, and has deterred the conduct 
it was intended to preclude; (3) The Commission order ignores crucial ""rate 
impacts"" associated with off-system capacity acquisition; and (4) The 
Commission's references to the ability of a pipeline acquiring offsystem 
capacity to release that capacity under the acquiring pipeline's tariff are 
unclear.

??????? Although the Commission's regulations do not provide for answers to 
rehearing requests, Dominion and Duke have asked that we intervene and 
respond to Indicated Shippers and Dynegy's request for rehearing in order to 
help the Commission formulate its decision.? As you may remember from INGAA's 
marketing affiliate comments, the Commission's December 14 order has a lot of 
excellent language in it, such as statements that holding offsystem capacity 
does not favor marketing affiliates, that INGAA wants to support.

??????? If Chairman Hebert wishes to keep his promise to do away with tolling 
orders, this rehearing would need to be acted on by Wednesday February 14, 
2001.? Accordingly, if INGAA wishes to be heard it must do so quickly.

??????? Please let me know by COB tomorrow whether you support INGAA 
responding to Indicated Shippers and Dynegy's request for rehearing.? If you 
agree, then I will proceed to get our Board of Directors' approval.",Enron Emails

Well lets see - where do I start- first of all I am in the process of moving 
to Denver- I am still in Scottsdale, AZ. I am moving next week to the 
Littleton area.  It been very annoying to move around this time but I had 
to. I took a position with the Denver Federal Center and they wanted me to 
start asap.  So I decided to make the move!

About me- I am 27 yrs old- very ambitious.  I work very hard but love to 
play hard as well. I feel that lifes to short and to be stressed out is just 
not worth it.  I like to be around professional people but they have to have 
a great sense of humor and like to have fun.  Someone with no personality is 
just not for me!!! I've been told I have a very warm personality- I pretty 
much can get along with everyone.  It surprises people but I never could 
understand that. They usually say that if they didnt know me, thats not what 
they would think.
I actually like to do about anything once.  My philosophy on what I like to 
do is - its not ""what"" we do its ""who"" we do it with. I do enjoy very much 
to go out and experience the nicer restaurants. I enjoy the theatre and 
musicals.  I can go on and on....
So if I havent answered your question.  Do ask...
DO you have any other pics to share?

94,"Norman,

My apologies for the delay in firming up the date of our trip.

Ay you may know, we had an explosion at our Teesside plant in
Northern England. The accident coincided with Greg's trip to London
and Greg got immersed in all the problems related to it. 

I hope to have a final decision on Monday morning when he comes back 
to Houston.

Vince,

Thanks for the package of material.

On our side, Aug 24 is looking better than Aug 17, but we can do Aug 17 if
it is much better for you.

    Best,

Subject: GTC for External FX products

Mark, we are trying to have everything completed so we could launch this 
product to go live on April 9th. Sara has already given us the approval on 
the GTCs for these FX products for external counterparties. The products do 
not have names as yet, but the FX team is working on it. Can you go ahead and 
review the GTC's for these products in the mean time and I will contact you 
with the names of the products as soon as we get them.
Thanks
jr

97,"Little David comes home from first grade and tells
his father that they learned about the history of Valentine's Day.

""Since Valentine's day is for a Christian saint and we're Jewish,"" he asks,
""will God get mad at me for giving someone a valentine?""

David's father thinks a bit, then says ""No, I don't
think God would get mad. Who do you want to give a valentine to?""

""Osama Bin Laden,"" David says.

""Why Osama Bin Laden,"" his father asks in shock.

""Well,"" David says, ""I thought that if a little American Jewish boy could
have enough love to give Osama a valentine, he might start to think that
maybe we're not all bad, and maybe start loving people a little bit. And if
other kids saw what I did and sent valentines to Osama, he'd love everyone a
lot. And then he'd start going all over the place to tell everyone how much
he loved them and how he didn't hate anyone anymore.""

His father's heart swells and he looks at his boy with newfound pride.
""David, that's the most wonderful thing I've ever heard.""

""I know,"" David says, ""and once that gets him out in
the open, the Marines could blow the shit out of him.""",Enron Emails
